# Myopia Detection Assistant

**Myopia Detection Assistant** is a classical machine-learning tool designed to classify **retinal fundus images** as either **Myopic** or **Normal**.  
It uses handcrafted image features and a **Random Forest classifier** to provide fast, interpretable, and accurate eye-health screening without deep learning.

## Features

- **Fundus Image Classification:** Detects whether a retina image shows Myopia.  
- **Explainable Model:** Uses interpretable features like brightness, contrast, entropy, edges, and sharpness  
- **High Accuracy:** 97.50% accuracy on 2000 fundus images  
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Runs on CPU â€” no GPU required  
- **Easy to Use:** Supports local + Google Colab setups

## How It Works

1. Upload retina images  
2. Extract handcrafted image features  
3. Train Random Forest model  
4. Predict: **Myopic / Normal**  
5. Optionally retrain on your dataset
